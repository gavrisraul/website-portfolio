# First Blog Post
## Hello world!

My name is Raul Gavri»ô, I live in Romania, Cluj-Napoca. I am a software developer and a student at UBB
Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science(2021 expected graduation) and here I am, writing my first blog post.  


```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
    cout << "Hello world!";
    return 0;
}
```

This was my first ever program I wrote back in 6th grade of school.  

After my introduction to programming using the pseudocode I went to C/C++.  


Then I saw what the power of the computer is.

First of all, I would like to say that I love to code and to see how the code I write slowly transforms into an application that can 
help with the automation of tasks or simply to code just for fun.  


I would like for this blog to post things that I am learning or have learned and to share my experience with you.  

Here it begins my path of becoming a software engineer.
