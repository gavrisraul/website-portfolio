# Let's learn git
## From beginner to advanced

Hello guys, here is Raul. This is the first tutorial I make
so please be patient with me.  

I decided to make a git tutorial and explain the flows I work with everyday in my
life as a software developer.  

First of all, the question we should ask ourselves is: "what is version control?".  
Well...version control systems are a category of software tools that help a team of
programmers manage source code over time. Basically VCS(version control system) keeps
track of every modification to the code in a kind of a database and enable them to collaborate. Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate their tasks through branches.

Ok, I have talked enough about the theory, let's put it into practice.  

I chose to use [github](https://github.com/) which in fact is the platform I work on.  

### First let's create a git repository
- Login to your github account
- Click on the new green button, repositories new
